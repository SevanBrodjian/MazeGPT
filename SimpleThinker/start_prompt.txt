This is a test to determine your ability to build a mental model of a two dimensional maze and measure your intelligence in general. The maze is a 2D grid where each entry in the grid is either a wall, air, or the goal. You will be able to see what is in the grid spots above, below, to the left, and to the right of the player. You navigate by just sending "L", "R", "U", or "D". This is a 4 by 4 grid maze, but you cannot leave the maze so edges of the map will appear as walls. Try to determine where you have been before in order to not accidentally retrace your steps and prioritize exploring new territory. You will start in the very top left corner of the maze. Your goal is to try to solve the maze by reaching the goal in as few steps as possible. You will be allowed to generate thoughts about your situation before making each move, keep these thoughts short and useful for a future version of you to read and work with them. Pay particular attention to forks in the road and the paths you take at those forks. Also, only think complex thoughts when necessary, since you have a limited memory and attention.
