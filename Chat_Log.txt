SYSTEM: Available Moves:  R. There are walls in these directions: U D L First, briefly explain your thoughts to make a more informed next move(s), saving a model of the world if necessary
GPT-4: Since the only available move is R, I don't need to remember any forks for now. I will move right.
SYSTEM: What will your move be?
GPT-4: R
SYSTEM: Available Moves:  D L. There are walls in these directions: U R First, briefly explain your thoughts to make a more informed next move(s), saving a model of the world if necessary
GPT-4: I came from L, so I will try the new path by moving D. I will remember this junction for future reference.
SYSTEM: What will your move be?
GPT-4: D
SYSTEM: Available Moves: U D R. There are walls in these directions:  L First, briefly explain your thoughts to make a more informed next move(s), saving a model of the world if necessary
GPT-4: I came from U, and going back is not helpful. I'll try moving R and remember that I can also move D as another option from this junction.
SYSTEM: What will your move be?
GPT-4: R
SYSTEM: Available Moves:  L R. There are walls in these directions: U D First, briefly explain your thoughts to make a more informed next move(s), saving a model of the world if necessary
GPT-4: I came from L, so I will continue moving R, and remember that I have an unexplored path going D from the previous junction.
SYSTEM: What will your move be?
GPT-4: R
SYSTEM: Available Moves:  D L. There are walls in these directions: U R First, briefly explain your thoughts to make a more informed next move(s), saving a model of the world if necessary
GPT-4: I reached a dead-end to the right. I'll go back L and try the unexplored path going D from the previous junction I passed. I can now discard this right path from memory.
SYSTEM: What will your move be?
GPT-4: L
SYSTEM: Available Moves:  L R. There are walls in these directions: U D First, briefly explain your thoughts to make a more informed next move(s), saving a model of the world if necessary
GPT-4: I'll continue moving L to return to the previous junction with the unexplored path going D, as I know the path to the right is a dead-end.
SYSTEM: What will your move be?
GPT-4: L
SYSTEM: Available Moves: U D R. There are walls in these directions:  L First, briefly explain your thoughts to make a more informed next move(s), saving a model of the world if necessary
GPT-4: I'm back at the junction where I have the unexplored path going D. So, I will now move D, as I've already tried moving R and U would be retracing my steps.
SYSTEM: What will your move be?
GPT-4: D
SYSTEM: You see the goal is one block beneath you. Available Moves: U D. There are walls in these directions:  L R First, briefly explain your thoughts to make a more informed next move(s), saving a model of the world if necessary
GPT-4: I see the goal below me, so my next move will be to go down (D) to reach it. No need to remember previous paths since the goal is in sight.
SYSTEM: What will your move be?
GPT-4: D
SYSTEM: Congratulations! You have reached the goal.
GPT-4: Thank you! I'm glad I was able to navigate through the maze successfully.
